================================

	OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project development layer for out of tree Realtek WiFi Linux kernel drivers
	
	It is expected to be used as a primary metadata layer for OE for these chipsets as it aggregates 
	more drivers than the original, rolling up things like aircrack-ng's version of the RTL8812AU
	driver that provides monitor mode and packet injection support to the mix.
	
	It is hoped that this is useful instead of useless...  >;-D
